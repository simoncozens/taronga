* ‚ö† **WARN** This font has a 'Soft Hyphen' character (codepoint 0x00AD) which is supposed to be zero-width and invisible, and is used to mark a hyphenation possibility within a word in the absence of or overriding dictionary hyphenation. It is mostly an obsolete mechanism now, and the character is only included in fonts for legacy codepage coverage. [code: softhyphen]
* ‚ö† **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

The following glyphs do not have the recommended number of contours:

	- Glyph name: exclam	Contours detected: 0	Expected: 2
	- Glyph name: quotedbl	Contours detected: 0	Expected: 2
	- Glyph name: numbersign	Contours detected: 0	Expected: 2
	- Glyph name: dollar	Contours detected: 0	Expected: 1 or 3
	- Glyph name: percent	Contours detected: 0	Expected: 5
	- Glyph name: ampersand	Contours detected: 0	Expected: 1, 2 or 3
	- Glyph name: quotesingle	Contours detected: 0	Expected: 1
	- Glyph name: parenleft	Contours detected: 0	Expected: 1
	- Glyph name: parenright	Contours detected: 0	Expected: 1
	- Glyph name: asterisk	Contours detected: 0	Expected: 1 or 4 
	- And 268 more.
